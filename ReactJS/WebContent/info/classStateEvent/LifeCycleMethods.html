	<h1>Life Cycle Methods</h1>
	<p>
		Each Class Component goes through a component life cycle with multiple phases.
		There are several life cycle methods that can be overridden to run code at different parts of the life cycle.
	</p>

	<h3>Mounting Phase Methods</h3>
	<p>
		The mounting phase begins when an instance of a component is created and rendered into the DOM.
		The following lifecycle methods occur in the order they are listed:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			constructor(props) - called when the component is first initialized. This method is only called once.
		</li>
		<li>
			componentWillMount() - called when a component is about to mount.
		</li>
		<li>
			render() - called when a component is rendered.
		</li>
		<li>
			componentDidMount() - called when a component has finished mounting. This is where network requests are usually made.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr/>


	<h3>Updating Phase Methods</h3>
	<p>
		The updating phase begins when a component's properties or state changes.
		The following lifecycle methods occur in the order they are listed:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) - called when a component has updated and is receiving new props.
		</li>
		<li>
			shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) - called after receiving props and is about to update.
			If this method returns false, componentWillUpdate(), render(), and componentDidUpdate() will not execute.
		</li>
		<li>
			componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) - called when a component is about to be updated.
		</li>
		<li>
			render() - called when a component is rerendered.
		</li>
		<li>
			componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) - called when a component has finished updating.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr/>


	<h3>Unmounting Phase Methods</h3>
	<p>
		The unmounting phase begins when a component is being removed from the DOM.
		The following life cycle method occurs during the unmounting phase:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			componentWillUnmount() - called when a component has been unmounted.
			This is where any cleanups are made such as cancelling timers or network requests.
		</li>
	</ul>
